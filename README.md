This is an example checkout page hacked together for the True Medicine tech interview!

It's hosted here:
[tmi-gazzini.vercel.app](https://tmi-gazzini.vercel.app/)

## Running Locally

Clone this repository!
`git clone https://github.com/Gazzini/tmi.git && cd tmi`

Make sure you're in the root directory (the same one as this `README.md` file), and run the following 2 commands:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
\
Then, navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your favorite web browser (which is Google Chrome).


## Compromises
* Security (src/lib/keys.tsx)
* Quality (all-around lol)
